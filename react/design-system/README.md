The Badge component is a customizable React component designed to display small pieces of information such as status indicators or labels. It supports various colors (neutral, error, warning, success, brand) and sizes (sm, md, lg), allowing for flexible styling. The component uses forwardRef to enable direct manipulation of the underlying span element, making it easy to integrate and use within different parts of an application.
