The project utilizes **Svelte 5** for building reactive and efficient user interfaces, combined with **TypeScript** for type safety and enhanced code quality. **HTML** and **CSS** are used for structuring and styling the components. The approach involves a component-based architecture, ensuring reusability and maintainability. Props are used for customization, allowing dynamic class names and flexible HTML attributes to be passed to the components.
